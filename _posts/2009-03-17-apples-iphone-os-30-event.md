[Comment From matvey]  
I would really like to see in 3.0 the long-promised background notifications  
9:08  
[Comment From Bob Woods]  
The thing I&#8217;d most like to see is the iPhone freed from AT&T. I&#8217;ll continue to use my 1G iPhone on T-Mobile regardless of Apple&#8217;s decisions, but I&#8217;d like to not have to fight them every step of the way. I&#8217;d like to have the option of buying a new model someday, but won&#8217;t if I&#8217;m forced to deal with AT&T.  
9:09  
[Comment From Bryan]  
What about texting landscape instead of portrait?  
9:09  
[Comment From Ty Dowding]  
I am hoping for something completely unexpected. I don&#8217;t mind getting some idea of what to expect, but these announcements have become a bit less exciting.  
9:10  
[Comment From Oyebto]  
Imagine Steve Jobs appearing.  
9:10  
[Comment From Rolphus]  
The main thing I&#8217;m hoping, somewhat counter-intuitively, is that Apple continue in the vein of the iPhone -> 3G and don&#8217;t introduce &#8220;breaking&#8221; hardware changes either at this event or in the near future. The fact that the platform isn&#8217;t fragmented is a huge strength for developers.  
9:11  
[Comment From DerickValadao]  
I&#8217;d like to see some exciting announcements of big 3rd party apps. Hulu anybody?  
9:11  
[Comment From Shirizaan]  
Unfortunately, I&#8217;m leaning towards the belief that all of the &#8220;predictions&#8221; for what will be revealed today are nothing more than wishful thinking. It seems like any desires the iPhone user base have fall upon deaf ears at Apple.  
9:11  
[Comment From Sam Gwilym]  
Speaking of background notification &#8211; it would be nice to see all those notifications delivered to the lock screen as is currently done with texts and missed calls/voicemail. An iPhone Growl, in a sense.  
9:13  
MrKurt:   Lots of people want landscape mode everywhere, text, notes, email.  
9:13  
[Comment From iBspoof]  
How about better battery life?  
9:13  
Ars Technica:    Scott Forstall is the VP of iPhone software, for those not in the know  
9:14  
[Comment From RogerWolf]  
Turn-by-turn GPS would make this device so much more useful to me&#8230; Right now, I&#8217;m often finding myself driving trying to find my way using the Google Maps with blinking dot. Highly annoying, and technically, illegal to drive like that.  
9:15  
[Comment From C F]  
I don&#8217;t want this, but I expect that there will be some features in the new OS which are not available on the 1G iPhone, for &#8220;performance&#8221; reasons. Naturally, this will mean that the early adopters from 2 years ago will need to upgrade and sign new 2 year contracts!  
9:17  
[Comment From Sebs]  
I&#8217;m just hoping for a snappier UI all together. For some reason, when you have something close to 5-6 pages of apps, even opening Settings up takes a couple of seconds&#8230;  
9:17  
Ars Technica:    There has apparently been a fire alarm (or something) at the Apple event according to our sources on the ground  
9:18  
[Comment From Mark]  
Voice dialing, voice dialing, & voice dialing would be nice  
9:19  
[Comment From tScott]  
What the iPhone really needs is a dedicated LED which blinks when you have missed a call or have pending text, etc.  
9:22  
[Comment From Jerrod]  
Hoping for: Developer sync API, Developer Search API, Bluetooth contact/calendar transfer, new home screen.  
9:22  
Ars Technica:    Everything is fine apparently, no one has burned to death  
9:23  
[Comment From grovberg]  
There should have been a OH DEAR GOD YES PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD option for the would you use stereo bluetooth headphones poll.  
9:23  
[Comment From PaulHart]  
I&#8217;d like to have a bit more transparency about the application approval process, even if it&#8217;s just a static page saying &#8220;the queue is currently X days long for new apps, Y days for upgrades&#8221; and a list of reasons why you&#8217;re likely to get rejected.  
9:24  
[Comment From Tap56]  
Full Taco support would be nice as long as the implement the meat/cheese framework correctly  
9:24  
Ars Technica:    We&#8217;re less than 40 minutes away now  
9:24  
[Comment From Jay Ray]  
I would more than likely use bluetooth for file transfer before I ever used it for headphones  
9:25  
[Comment From Ryan]  
Today they are going to announce &#8220;I AM RICH 2.0&#8221;  
9:27  
MrKurt:  THANKS FOR THE RICKROLLS GUYS.  
9:27  
[Comment From Jerry A]  
I don&#8217;t have an iPhone, but my Blackberry plays music through my bluetooth car handsfree, which broadcasts through FM to my stereo. Wireless music, as well as phone call interruption. I&#8217;d love to do that when I get an iPhone. So not for headphones, but car use.  
9:27  
Ars Technica:    Just so everyone is aware, we are reading all your comments, but they are not automatically made public, we&#8217;ll promote them if you have something cool to say<img src='http://mirkov.info/wp-includes/images/blank.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley smiley-2' />  
9:29  
[Comment From Jet]  
Something cool to say? How about, &#8220;MrKurt is a lovely human being and he smells like vanilla and strawberries.&#8221;  
9:29  
Ars Technica:    That wasn&#8217;t very cool actually  
9:31  
Jacqui:  For someone who asked, the peanut gallery comments won&#8217;t be going on during the live event. We&#8217;re just promoting some of them now as people wait.  
9:31  
MrKurt:   Just so everyone knows, we&#8217;re getting about 15 comments per second, so we&#8217;re not intentionally leaving you out.  
9:31  
Twitter chartier:  Registered and waiting for the apple event to begin. http://twitpic.com/26ok0  
9:31  
[Comment From nova]  
I&#8217;d love to see that push infrastructure finally built. While desktop client to SMS works, a true client solution would be better. As soon as that is created, maybe we can have push IRC clients for keeping up with #macintosh.  
9:31  
[Comment From Fractile81]  
How much you want to bet they add support for the Shuffle&#8217;s new headphones and single-&#8220;button&#8221; interfacing?  
9:32  
Expand  
9:34  
[Comment From Chris Rodkey]  
I would love an actual, serious explanation about why Apple completely blew off its September deadline for push notifications and then just decided the solution was to pretend they never talked about it in the first place.  
9:35  
[Comment From Mr. Poopy]  
+1 for triple click home button functionality  
9:36  
Ars Technica:  We have several thousands of people watching the live blog now, plus a lot more in IRC, tell all your friends on IRC  
9:36  
[Comment From Brian]  
If we don&#8217;t get full background app support, at LEAST let Pandora (or SOME streaming music app) have background access.  
9:36  
Ars Technica:    I meant Twitter, of course  
9:38  
[Comment From smaffei]  
How about letting me remove standard apps I don&#8217;t use like Weather.  
9:39  
MrKurt:   Just a reminder, comments are moderated so you won&#8217;t necessarily see what you post appear in the feed.  
9:41  
[Comment From plg]  
how about a new standard app (that receives real time push notifications) to keep iPhone users updated &#8211; to the second &#8211; on Steve&#8217;s health? It could even be linked directly with the Stocks app ;)

9:54  
Ars Technica:    I&#8217;m going to be turning off the polls here soon, does anyone have any brilliant final comments before the event starts?

Expand  
10:08  
David Chartier:    &#8220;This is a major update to the iPhone operating system.&#8221;  
10:09  
David Chartier:  &#8221; It comes with incredible features for developers and customers,&#8221; starting to talk about what&#8217;s here for developers.  
10:09  
David Chartier:  If you lose the site we&#8217;re posting this to irc.arstechnica.com #appleevent and http://twitter.com/arsInfiniteLoop  
10:09  
David Chartier:    Scott notes that Apple provides the same API tools it uses to developers, and this is the next generation of the native SDK with 1,000 new APIs.  
10:11  
David Chartier:    Scott notes developers&#8217; freedom of offering apps for free or setting a price, where Apple takes 30 percent and charges on credit card fees.  
10:11  
David Chartier:    Scott notes that devs are requesting other business models, like subscriptions, additional level charges, and new content for apps.  
10:12  
David Chartier:    &#8220;These days you have to sell one application per book, for example, and developers want a book store built into the app.&#8221;  
10:12  
David Chartier:    &#8220;Today we&#8217;re supporting all of these additional business models.&#8221;  
10:12  
David Chartier:    Demoing system for purchasing new content from within an app.  
10:12  
David Chartier:    &#8220;You can now purchase a game that comes wiht 10 levels, and when you&#8217;re done playing those levels, you can purchase the next 10 levels for the game.&#8221;  
10:13  
David Chartier:  Another example: city guides. With iPhone OS 3.0, you can sell one generic application with seprate &#8220;city packs.&#8221;  
10:13  
David Chartier:    All of it is tied into the iTunes Store. You&#8217;re asked for your iTunes password but you remain within the app.  
10:14  
David Chartier:  Audience has been silenced, iPod ad music is playing.  
10:14  
David Chartier:    Developer picks the price for in-app purchased items. Same 70 percent goes to developer, charing no credit card fees, and developers are still paid monthly. But: this is only for paid apps; free apps cannot charge for content.  
10:14  
David Chartier:  &#8220;Free apps remain free.&#8221;  
10:15  
David Chartier:    Now: Peer to Peer connectivity.  
10:15  
David Chartier:  Scott offers an example: kids in the car and they want to play games back and forth.  
10:15  
David Chartier:    iPhone 3.0 now has a standard system for finding other devices in the same area &#8211; no WiFi network needed.  
10:16  
David Chartier:    Automatic discovery performed over Bluetooth.  
10:16  
David Chartier:    No pairing.  
10:16  
David Chartier:    Bonjour-powered, and not just for games, but games are an obvious implication.  
10:17  
David Chartier:  Now, Accessories  
10:17  
David Chartier:    &#8220;Thriving ecosystem for accessories. Thousands of developers building thousands of accessories.&#8221; Demonstrates a speaker set that works with the iPhone.  
10:17  
David Chartier:    Taking accessory support to the &#8220;next level.&#8221;  
10:18  
David Chartier:    iPhone OS 3.0 can talk directly to an accessory.  
10:18  
David Chartier:    iPhone can control the speaker&#8217;s EQ, for example.  
10:18  
David Chartier:    Now talking about FM transmitters for cars.  
10:18  
David Chartier:    FM signal can be controlled from the iPhone&#8217;s display.  
10:19  
David Chartier:    Now talking about medical devices and accessories.  
10:19  
David Chartier:    iPhone apps can send data from medical devices straight to doctors.  
10:19  
David Chartier:    Also enabling some of this over Bluetooth. &#8220;We support all the standard built-in protocols.&#8221;  
10:19  
Expand  
10:19  
David Chartier:    &#8220;Or build your own custom protocols if you want.&#8221;  
10:20  
David Chartier:    Now: Maps.  
10:20  
David Chartier:    Touts working with Google to build a great Maps app.  
10:21  
David Chartier:    &#8220;We&#8217;re taking the heart of the Maps application and making it a public API so developers can embed that map in their apps.&#8221;  
10:21  
David Chartier:    You can pinch and zoom, get satellite view, hybrid, standard map, add custom notes, use WiFi and cell triangulation.&#8221;  
10:22  
David Chartier:  Even reverse geocoding.  
10:22  
David Chartier:    Now enabling developers to use Core Location as the basis for turn by turn apps.  
10:22  
David Chartier:  Can use WiFi and cell triangulation, but there&#8217;s one catch: &#8220;Bring your own maps.&#8221;  
10:22  
David Chartier:  Due to licensing, Apple cannot allow developers to use the Maps app tiles.  
10:23  
David Chartier:    Finally: Push Notifications. &#8220;We&#8217;re late on this one.&#8221;  
10:23  
David Chartier:    Within two months of launchign the app store, we had over 1,000 apps on the store, and over 100,000,000 downloaded apps.  
10:23  
David Chartier:    &#8220;We had to complete rearchitect the server for Push Notifications.&#8221;  
10:23  
David Chartier:  &#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been doing over the last 6 months.&#8221;  
10:24  
David Chartier:  Now tackling background processes: &#8220;It&#8217;s not good for the customer.&#8221;  
10:24  
David Chartier:    Bkg processes don&#8217;t let the phone go to sleep, drain the battery, etc.  
10:24  
David Chartier:    Apple tested apps that ran in the bkg on BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, etc.  
10:25  
David Chartier:    &#8220;In all cases, standby time dropped by 80 percent or more.&#8221;  
10:25  
David Chartier:    Using Push Notifications on iPhone, standby time only dropped by 23 percent when testing an IM app.  
10:25  
David Chartier:    Apple has been working with 3rd party developers already to test this, now talking about an IM app, looks like AIM.  
10:26  
David Chartier:    Now refreshing about how Push Notifications work: 3rd party server pushes notifications through to Apple and to the user&#8217;s iPhone.  
10:26  
David Chartier:    Can push sounds, text alerts  
10:27  
David Chartier:    &#8220;The nice part about this is: it scales.&#8221;  
10:27  
David Chartier:    Push Notifications is a &#8220;unified, generic service for all devs.&#8221; Maintains battery life, performance, and has been optimized for mobile networks.  
10:27  
David Chartier:  &#8220;We&#8217;re doing all the hard work&#8221; of customizing Push Notifications for all 80 countries the iPhone is in. &#8220;Each carrier works differently.&#8221;  
10:28  
David Chartier:    Now discussing more of the new APIs. Has a new email sheet so apps don&#8217;t have to quit.  
10:28  
David Chartier:    Proximity sensors, iPod library access.  
10:28  
Expand  
10:28  
David Chartier:    Streaming audio and video over HTTP so it even goes through firewalls.  
10:28  
David Chartier:    Data detectors, built in VoIP APIs.  
10:29  
David Chartier:    Introducing some developers who have been testing this.  
10:29  
David Chartier:

10:31  
David Chartier:    Paul is typing, audience chuckles as some misspellings.
